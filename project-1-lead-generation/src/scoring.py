"""AI-powered lead scoring (simulated Claude responses for demo).

Scores each enriched lead 1-10 from five weighted signals:
  - Company size       (budget signal)
  - Annual revenue     (spending capacity)
  - Contact seniority  (decision-making authority)
  - Pain urgency       (immediacy of need)
  - Lead source        (intent quality)

In production, replace _score_lead's logic block with a real
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create() call and parse the JSON response.
